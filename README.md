#Rules
A SET consists of 3 cards in which each of the cards features, looked at one-by-one, are the same on each card, or, are different on each card. 
All of the features must separately satisfy this rule.
In other words: shape must be either the same in all 3 cards, or different on each if the 3 cards; color must be either the same on all 3 cards, or different on each of the 3, etc.
